## 💡 Interview Tips

### For DSA:
1. **Clarify constraints** before coding
2. **Think aloud** - explain your approach
3. **Start with brute force**, then optimize
4. **Test with examples** before submitting
5. **Know time/space complexity**

### For LLD:
1. **Gather requirements** first
2. **Draw class diagrams** before coding
3. **Focus on interfaces** and contracts
4. **Discuss design patterns** where applicable
5. **Consider thread safety** and edge cases
